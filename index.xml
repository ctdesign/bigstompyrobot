      <description>Big Stompy Robot is the comic alter ego of Chris Taylor.
Drawing was always my thing when I was young. I used to spend hours doodling on rolls of plain wallpaper my dad brought home from work. But as I got older, I fell out of practice with the usual life stuff consuming all of my time, and before I knew it I had ended up not touching a pencil for years.</description>

      <description>Hullo.
Just before crimbo, I finally got to a point where I was ready to get feedback on Red Night. Up until this point I had only talked with people about it in vague, broad terms and discussed specifics about plot points with my wife. But no one else had read anything about it, properly.
Normally I would like to get feedback throughout the development process. However, for me, that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really work, because: a.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve long harboured an ambition to draw my own comic.
I loved spending hours as a child quietly doodling away in my room, being perfectly content in whatever world I was conjuring up. But I fell out of practice as I got older and entered the world of work and the usul life stuff started getting in the way.

      <description>Hi there.
I&amp;rsquo;ve done a bit of tinkering and updated the site with a new blog, a bit more info about me and details on my new comic, Red Night .
I&amp;rsquo;m mostly planning to use this to share my work-in-progress, things I&amp;rsquo;m learning about the comics making process and other comic related musings.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also set up Instagram and Twitter profiles for Big Stompy Robot, so please follow me there too.</description>
