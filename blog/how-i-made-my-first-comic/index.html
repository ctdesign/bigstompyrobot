  <h1 class="heading-l" id="title">How I make my first comic</h1>

  <div>
        <article id="content">
           <p>I&rsquo;ve long harboured an ambition to draw my own comic.</p>
<p>I loved spending hours as a child quietly doodling away in my room, being perfectly content in whatever world I was conjuring up. But I fell out of practice as I got older and entered the world of work and the usul life <em>stuff</em> started getting in the way.</p>
<p>However I was lucky enough a few years ago to get an iPad Pro and Pencil for my birthday, which rekindled my love of drawing. After posting several pieces of portrait work, friends and colleagues helped give me the confidence that I was good enough to give it a go.</p>
<p>The only small problem left was where to start.</p>
<p>I knew enough about the comic making process to know that it&rsquo;s generally not a great idea to just start drawing and pray that a comic will miraculously come out of the other end. You need to start with a story idea. The only problem was - I wasn&rsquo;t a writer. I hadn&rsquo;t written anything creatively since School.</p>
<p>Now I could have just adapted an existing story (like an out of copyright story) to give me a kick start, but I was also wanting to draw something that interested me and held my attention. Plus, I very consciously didn&rsquo;t want to be overly ambitious and never actually finish something - I needed constraints.</p>
<p>A lot of creatives complain about constraints (usually meaning time, money or other&rsquo;s interference), but I love them. Probably because I&rsquo;m a more pragmatically minded person, but also from my career experience in the digital industry - constraints to me are the secret sauce to ensure that creative people don&rsquo;t get lost don&rsquo;t a rabit hole. They help focus and set helpful boundires for you work. And the constraints I set myself was making sure that this story would be less that 30 pages and feature a small cast of characters. I wanted it to be a short, self-contained story - essentially like a short novella.</p>
<p>So I started actively dedicating some time to try brainstorm some ideas, in evenings and the weekend. But I found concentrating hard at the end of a long work day. One thing that helped was escaping for a short break on my own (another great birthday gift from my wife) to just have the time and space to think and come up with something. And I hit on an idea that I liked, which got me really enthused and excited. I continued expanding the idea after the break, trying to develop the story.</p>
<p>And then I abandoned it. And it wasn&rsquo;t the last time I abandoned work. Over the next couple of years I ended up developing two or three full scripts (along with several more half finished outlines and story ideas), even taking some to pencil rough and layout stage. I kept hitting story problems or couldn&rsquo;t think of interesting plot points. After some introspection I realised that I had two main problems.</p>
<p>The first was that I was rushing each stage of the process. My plan was suppposed to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write outline of story</li>
<li>Break down the outline and write up a full script with panel descriptions and dialogue</li>
<li>Create thumbnails (small rough drawings to help plan the layout and panel content)</li>
<li>Develop full sized rough pencils and layout</li>
<li>Add lettering</li>
<li>Maybe colour it</li>
<li>Publish it digitally somewhere.
But I would move onto the script before I had properly worked out the spine of the story in the outline. I would start the thumbnails before I had actually written all of the dialogue or thought at the script stage what moments I wanted panels to show. This then created problems as I moved onto the next stage resulting in either unresolvable issues or a loss of enthusiasm.</li>
</ol>
<p>But since this would be my first comic, I wanted to learn as much as I could by doing a lot of it myself. I also wanted to set myself some challenging but sensible constraints for my first story to ensure I actually finished the thing.</p>
<p>At the moment - I&rsquo;m not actually trying to break into the comics industry or become a full time comics creator. I actually like my day job, and it&rsquo;s a good income, so for me starting out again in an unpredictable industry isn&rsquo;t something I really want to do.</p>
